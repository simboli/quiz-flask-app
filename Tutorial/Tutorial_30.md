Yes, with the changes to include the question number in the `quiz_log` table, the structure of the table needs to be updated to include the new `question_number` column. Here's the modified CREATE TABLE script for the `quiz_log` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE quiz_log (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id VARCHAR(255),
    question_number INT,
    question_id INT,
    question VARCHAR(255),
    user_answers TEXT,
    correct_answers TEXT,
    is_correct BOOLEAN,
    answer_time DATETIME,
    last_modified_time DATETIME
);
```

In this script, the `question_number` column has been added to represent the number of the question in the quiz. This column will store an integer value that corresponds to the order of the questions in the quiz.

Make sure to execute this SQL script in your database to update the `quiz_log` table with the new column structure.
