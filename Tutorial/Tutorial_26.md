The error you're encountering is because you are trying to insert an empty string `''` into the `last_modified_time` column, which is expected to be of type DATETIME.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that you are providing a valid timestamp in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' (e.g., '2024-02-15 14:30:00') for the `last_modified_time` column when inserting data into the `quiz_log` table.

Here's an example of how you can update your Python code to ensure that a valid timestamp is always provided for `last_modified_time`:

```python
# JavaScript in HTML template
<input type="hidden" name="last_modified_{{ question['question_id'] }}" id="last_modified_{{ question['question_id'] }}" value="{{ current_timestamp }}">

# app.py
# ...
for question in selected_questions:
    user_answers = request.form.getlist(question['question'])
    correct_answers = question['correct_answers']
    
    for answer in user_answers:
        current_timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  # Get current timestamp
        cursor.execute(
            "INSERT INTO quiz_log (session_id, question_id, question, user_answers, correct_answers, is_correct, answer_time, last_modified_time) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)",
            (session.get('session_id'), question['question_id'], question['question'], answer, answer, answer in correct_answers, datetime.now(), current_timestamp)
        )
    # ...
```

In this code:

- We obtain the current timestamp using `datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')` and store it in the `current_timestamp` variable.
- We then use `current_timestamp` to set the `value` of the hidden input field for `last_modified_{{ question['question_id'] }}` in the HTML template.
- When inserting data into the `quiz_log` table, we use `current_timestamp` for the `last_modified_time` column to ensure that a valid timestamp is always provided.

This way, you'll avoid inserting empty strings and ensure that the `last_modified_time` column receives a valid timestamp in the correct format.
