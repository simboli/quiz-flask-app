I apologize for the oversight. You are correct; the current JavaScript code updates all hidden fields for every question, resulting in the same timestamp for all questions. To address this issue, you need to uniquely identify and update the hidden field associated with each question.

Here's how you can modify the JavaScript to correctly update the `last_modified_time` for each question:

```html
<!-- Update the JavaScript code in your HTML template -->
<script>
    $(document).ready(function () {
        $("input[type='checkbox']").change(function () {
            // Find the closest question div to the changed checkbox
            var questionDiv = $(this).closest('.question');

            // Get the question ID from the question div
            var questionId = questionDiv.attr('id');

            // Find the hidden input field for last_modified_time
            var lastModifiedField = $("#last_modified_" + questionId);

            // Update the last modified timestamp for this question
            lastModifiedField.val(new Date().toISOString());
        });

        $("#submit-button").click(function () {
            $("#quiz-form").submit();
        });
    });
</script>
```

With this modification, the JavaScript code correctly identifies and updates the `last_modified_time` hidden field for the specific question associated with the changed checkbox. This ensures that each question has its own unique timestamp for the last modification.

Please update your HTML template with this JavaScript code, and it should resolve the issue.
