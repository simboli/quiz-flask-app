Creating a full-featured quiz application in Python Flask with a JSON file to store questions and answers, along with a responsive front-end, is a substantial project. Below is a simplified example to get you started. You can expand upon this foundation as needed.

First, make sure you have Flask installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

Now, let's create the quiz application step by step:

1. Create a directory for your project and set up the file structure:

```
quiz_app/
   ├── app.py
   ├── templates/
   │   ├── index.html
   │   └── result.html
   └── questions.json
```

2. Populate `questions.json` with your quiz questions and answers. Here's an example format:

```json
[
    {
        "question": "What is the capital of France?",
        "choices": ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid"],
        "correct_answers": ["Paris"]
    },
    {
        "question": "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
        "choices": ["Mars", "Venus", "Jupiter", "Saturn"],
        "correct_answers": ["Mars"]
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the largest mammal in the world?",
        "choices": ["Elephant", "Whale Shark", "Blue Whale", "Giraffe"],
        "correct_answers": ["Blue Whale"]
    }
]
```

3. Now, let's create the Flask application in `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash
import json

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'

# Load questions from JSON file
with open('questions.json', 'r') as file:
    questions = json.load(file)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', questions=questions)

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    score = 0
    for question in questions:
        user_answers = request.form.getlist(question['question'])
        correct_answers = question['correct_answers']
        if set(user_answers) == set(correct_answers):
            score += 1
    flash(f'Your score: {score}/{len(questions)}', 'success')
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

4. Create `templates/index.html` for the quiz interface:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Quiz App</title>
    <style>
        /* Add your CSS for responsiveness here */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Quiz App</h1>
    <form method="POST" action="/submit">
        {% for question in questions %}
            <h2>{{ question['question'] }}</h2>
            {% for choice in question['choices'] %}
                <input type="checkbox" name="{{ question['question'] }}" value="{{ choice }}">
                {{ choice }}<br>
            {% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

5. Create `templates/result.html` for displaying the quiz result:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Quiz Result</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Quiz Result</h1>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
    <a href="/">Back to Home</a>
</body>
</html>
```

6. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to access the quiz. You can further enhance the CSS and add more features as needed for responsiveness and interactivity.
